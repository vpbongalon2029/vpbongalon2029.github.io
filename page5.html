        <h1>What are my thoughts on the novel?</h1>

            <p class="yappatron">I personally think the novel is GREAT. The imagery is vivid, immersive an the details are in a quantity that isn't overwhelming but give you the full picture. WHile reading the book, I felt like i was inside Montags point of view, holding the python and spewing kerosene with the smell of fire, ash and gasoline sticking to my clothes. The book is a unique case in the sense that even though the main theme is about censorship, the main topic is about how television could kill literature, which it is effectively doing now. He portrays a world that isn't ruled by a totalitarian government like most books of this genre, however it portrays a world wherein the people cause their own downfall due to their sensitivity to certain content. In the book, books are banned because they caused some people to feel offended, which led to the formation of firemen who start fires instead of stopping them. </p>

            <div class="para">
                    <p class="yappatron">The book has great imagery as I have said before, but the plot and character development is also some of the best and most entertaining that I have seen in a while. Montag's slow but sure realization that books aren't evil is so satisfying to watch and the way he rebels against the firemen by burning Captain Beatty to ash is a climax done right. Overall, the pacing is not too fast that you'll be wanting more and not too slow where it feels like you're going to sleep just by reading it.</p>
